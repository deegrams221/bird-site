This site was built for a bird breeder with the intention to showcase her birds and provide an easy way for potential clients to contact her.
<br>

### Version: 1.0

Single page webpage with the client provided information, and images. Contact form that routes messages directly to the client's email. Links to the client's various social media pages. Links to the client's preferred vendors. Formatted for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

### Current version: 2.0

The client would like to have a login, once logged in the client will be able to upload images and descriptions of the birds they have available for purchase in an 'inventory' page. Users will be able to view the inventory but will not be able to login. Also plan to create a backend in Firebase, so the client can easily upload and maintain the artifacts.
