          <p>
            We are a small hobby breeder based out of Lawrenceville, GA. We
            breed Cockatiels, Green Cheeked Conures, Bourke's Parakeets, and
            Budgies. We love helping individuals and families find the right
            type of pet bird for them!
            <br /> <br />
            We started raising and breeding birds a few years ago. We do our
            best to make sure our birds are healthy and strong. Birds are so
            much fun to raise because they are social creatures. They can greet
            you good morning with songs and all those cute bird sounds. They can
            also welcome you home and relieve your stress with their songs at
            night.

                <b>Bourke's Parakeets</b> are a great introductory bird for new
                bird owners; they have a calm demeanor and they keep themselves
                entertained. They are ideal for apartment living because they
                are quiet. They are excellent partners for finches and
                cockatiels as well as other Bourke's parakeets. Keep gentle
                Bourke's parakeets away from larger, aggressive birds.

                <b>Opaline Budgies</b> are the most common variant of budgie.
                Budgies are often referred to as the "most popular bird" because
                there are more budgies in the world than any other type of pet
                bird. Budgies are known to have a big personality too; theyâ€™re
                small but full of character, cramming all the charisma of a
                parrot into a package not much bigger than a canary.

                found all over most of Australia. Cockatiels are part of the
                parrot family, and are considered the most popular of the parrot
                family. They are closely related to the Cockatoos too.

            <b>Did you know that birds are really smart?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Studies have shown that birds have great problem-solving skills and
            cognitive skills that prove their high-level of intellect. They have
            excellent navigation skills and migrate thousands of miles twice a
            year. <br />
            <br />
            Because they are smart, training and taming birds is easy. Among
            those bird breeds that are classified intelligent and easy to train
            are cockatiels, parrots, and cockatoos.
