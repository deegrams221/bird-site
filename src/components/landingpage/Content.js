          <p>
            K & B Aviary was started a few years ago, because we have a passion
            for raising birds. We have worked in many pet shops and with many
            different types of birds. We've decided to raise Cockatiels,
            Green-Cheeked Conures, Bourke's Parakeets, and Budgies because they
            are the most fun!

                <b>Bourke's Parakeets</b> are a great introductory bird for new
                bird owners; they have a calm demeanor and they keep themselves
                entertained. They are ideal for apartment living because they
                are quiet. They are excellent partners for finches and
                cockatiels as well as other Bourke's parakeets. Keep gentle
                Bourke's parakeets away from larger, aggressive birds.

                <b>Opaline Budgies</b> are the most common variant of budgie.
                Budgies are often referred to as the "most popular bird" because
                there are more budgies in the world than any other type of pet
                bird. Budgies are known to have a big personality too; theyâ€™re
                small but full of character, cramming all the charisma of a
                parrot into a package not much bigger than a canary.

                <b>Cinnamon Cockatiels</b> are unique in that they are a strain
                developed by breeders and are not found in the wild. Grey
                cockatiels are mostly what is seen in the wild and they are
                found all over most of Australia. Cockatiels are part of the
                parrot family, and are considered the most popular of the parrot
                family. They are closely related to the Cockatoos too.
